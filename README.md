# Rail Fence Cipher Encryption

This Python program performs the Rail Fence Cipher encryption. The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that involves arranging the characters of a message in a zigzag pattern across a set number of "rails" or rows. The resulting pattern is then read horizontally to obtain the encrypted message.
