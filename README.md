# Rail Fence Cipher Encryption

## Overview

The Rail Fence Cipher Encryption program is a Python tool for performing the Rail Fence Cipher encryption. The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that arranges message characters in a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows (rails), and the resulting pattern is read horizontally to obtain the encrypted message.

## Features

- **Matrix Generation:** Create a matrix representing the zigzag pattern based on the number of rails.

- **Message Encryption:** Fill in the matrix with the message characters and print the resulting Rail Fence matrix.
